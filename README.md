Requires AutoHotKey v2 installed on your system

Download it from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Disconnect and reconnect system is stable on this verison I am working on. I want to do a GUI overhaul which will allow you to enter in settings much easier than editing the script before. 

This is a pre-release which I won't make a video on, I wanted those who chose to come to my discord server to have early access to this powerful feature.

You aren't required to switch to this if you don't want to, it does require a bit of setup work with the script manually. Version 2 is completely fine to use for the next few days still, while I get this GUI stuff sorted

If you choose to try v3.0-beta , follow the instructions inside the script where there are stars ‚≠ê 

F1 - Start fishing
F2 - Stop fishing
F6 - Creates a message box containing the coordinates of your mouse cursor positon (x, y)
F7 - Debug command to check if white pixel is found
F8 - Opens teleport menu and scrolls down number of time according to fishing area selected, a message box will appear to remind you to get the coordinates of the target location teleport icon so you can add those into the script. Make sure you start from the top of the map menu before running the command, and the teleporter map is closed

Ensure when you download the files, it contains a folder with 2 images and your main script outside the images folder. It will look something like the image I've posted below.
