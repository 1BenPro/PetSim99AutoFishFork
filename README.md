Requires AutoHotKey v2 installed on your system

- F1 to activate the macro when it's open
- F2 to deactivate the macro when it's active
- F6 to grab coordinates of the current mouse positon

You'll need F6 if you play on resolutions other than 1920x1080 until I make the macro cross-compatible from the start.

If you play on other resolutions, you'll need to edit these lines:
- 39 and 41 (these don't need to be precise, they only need to be on the water ingame where you see the bobble icon appear when you hover over)
- 64 and 74 (around the center of the screen or wherever you would like to click to cast your fishing rod and click to reel in)

Between lines 58 and 83, you may edit the timings so it's suited to your internet connection. If you have better internet, you may use tigher timings, and vice versa. 
Would not recommend changing lines 73 unless you are having trouble recasting fishing rod after catching one. Don't really need to change line 75.

Open in notepad or a code editor to change the lines specified

The code is commented so you may understand how it works. Enjoy easy afk fishing!
